        <strong>The groups</strong>
    </p>
    <p>A group is a collaborative space containing internal or guest users.
        <br>This view allows the management of these groups and their members. At no time can the administrator access or administer the contents (files) of a group.
        <i>NB: The files deposited in a group belong to the group and not to the user, so they have no impact on the user quota.</i>
