        <strong>Configuration of the domain order</strong>
    </p>
    <p>When a user is present in multiple domains with the same email address, then it is necessary to activate the list of domains present in {{ 'COMMON.NAME' | translate }}.
        <br>This allows the user to choose which domain he will depend on during this session. By default this list is not displayed.
        <br>
        <br>This view allows you to configure the display order of the domains in this list.</p>
